# Seekers-Web-An-Annotation-Hub

The ultimate intention of this website is to serve as a platform for authors/individuals to store, organize, and share snippets, articles, and thoughts that could contribute to future editions or related works. It acts as a dynamic extension of their published books, allowing for ongoing engagement with their audience and the evolution of their ideas.

The Website is still in the making.

This website would let authors add snnipets, extensions,add-on to thier pre existing works- books, papers,references,etc.

It gives user an ability to search thru the snippets by keyword, heading to bring up the specific snippet(s).

As in the image below, the word "World" is present in no snippet so nothing is pulled up
